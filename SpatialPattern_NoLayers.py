##This is a refactored Python version of my spatial pattern analysis program, published 
##in Morgan et al., 2012. The program examines the distribution of cellular or other 
##populations to determine whether they are randomly spaced or instead more or less closely 
##clustered together than expected. This version assumes no layer information (i.e. a tissue 
##sample without cortical layers). For a non-homogenous, layered sample, please see 
##SpatialPatternRefactor.py.

##Summary of method:
##This program looks at the recorded x, y-coordinates of each cell in a region of interest.
##If the cell is far enough from the boundaries of the ROI that we can investigate the full
##distance range around it without running into ROI edge effects, the program calculates the 
##distance to all of the other cells of the appropriate cell class in the sample. It then
##marks each matching instance at the distance between the cells and all of the farther 
##distances within the analysis range.

##The program then generates simulations of cellular distribution, which have randomized cell
##locations. It compares an average of these simulation values to the actual distribution of 
##cells to detect inhomogeneities in their organization.

##Section 1: setting up your computer to run this program
##This program is written in Python 2.6-2.7. It also uses the xlwt addon library to make Excel 
##spreadsheets.

##Step 1: Install Python 2.7.3 from here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
##On the page, select the Windows MSI installer (x86 if you have 32-bit Windows installed,
##x86-64 if you have 64-bit Windows installed.)
##I suggest using the default option, which will install Python to c:/Python27

##Step 2: Install the xlwt library from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt/
##Use the program WinRAR to unzip the files to a directory
##Go to "run" in the start menu and type cmd
##Type cd c:\directory_where_xlwt_was_unzipped_to
##Type setup.py install

##Step 3: Copy this program into the c:/Python27 directory
##You can also put it into another directory that is added to the correct PATH.

##Section 2: file preparation for this program (and related scripts)

##Record coordinates of all cells belonging to the populations of interest in a rectangular
##counting frame in Stereo Investigator. Take the raw cellular coordinates and save as a 
##.txt file. Set your variables in the section below, and run the program.

####################################################################
##User set variables here

#Directory containing input files
directory = "C:\Users\John Morgan\Documents\sp_datafiles"

#Save cell coordinate data from Stereo Investigator as a tab-delimited text file
#There should be a header, leave it in
#This test file is actually from a layered sample. Note the strong clustering
#this program reports with this input. This is because the layering effectively
#packs many of the cells in dense clusters relative to a non-layered distribution.
inputfile = "NoLayer_B4925.txt"

#This is the name of the .xls file that the program will save when finished. 
outputfile = "nolayer_test"

#This is the name of the .xls file that the program will save when finished. 
outputfile = "test"

##This variable adjusts the cell types that are being compared. Input the values in the
##first column of your saved .txt file.
##In the demo run, neuron = 1, microglia = 3 
##To look at the properties of a single population, set both of these values the same.
cell1 = 1
cell2 = 3

##This variable sets distance from the ROI boundary at which seed cells will be
##excluded from analysis to avoid edge effects
exclude_dist = 100

##This variable adjusts the studied distance and interval in the cleaned output file.
##Do not exceed the excluded distance or you will have edge effects distorting your
##results!
analysis_dist = 100

##This variable adjusts the number of interrogation points over the analysis range.
##It is strongly suggested to match analysis_dist unless you are looking to cut noise
##with larger distance bins.
interval_num = 100

##The number of simulations to run; the results are averaged and then the clustering
##values are divided by the simulation results to produce a clustering ratio.
##In Morgan et al., 2012, I ran 200 simulations/condition. Experimentation indicated 
##that this number of simulations resulted in <1% variability in results.
sim_run_num = 5
